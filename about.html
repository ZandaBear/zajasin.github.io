                        This semester, our junior class went through a immersive, economics course. We leared about taxes, insurance, and how to navigate our finances in our adult lives. We all feel so much better knowing about how our financed work and feeling confident with how we can take charge of our finances. We wanted to share this feeling with other kids so we made with resource for other kids to learn the important things that we've learned this year.
